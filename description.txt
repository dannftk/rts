1) Go to the root of the project (I mean 'rts directory')
2) Execute 'configure' script (./configure) to create new directories in the rts and other applications' directories
3) Make the project 'make all'. If there are some problems contact me
4) Ok, now you have just built an amazing project called RTS (Real Time System I presume it means :))
    Go to the 'bin' directory. There are going to be several applications waiting for being run
    There are applications:
        * gateway (it is resposible for main and concurent operations-calculations)
        * deststation (do not confuse with destination, it is another word :) Actually, I personally used to confuse them :)
            this applications is requesting values of the ending vector from gateway
            and getting results from it on finishing)
        * mclient (provides values of a matrix)
        * vlcient (provides values of a vector)
5) Run the applications as background processes (you could leave the last one as a foreground, as you want).
    Gateway process is supposed to be run the first:

        bash> ./gateway &
        bash> ./destation &
        bash> ./mclient ../files/matrix_A.txt 0 &
        bash> ./mclient ../files/matrix_C.txt 1 &
        bash> ./vclient ../files/vector_b.txt 2 &
        bash> ./vclient ../files_vector_d.txt 3 &

    Do not confuse the parameters and their order! :)
    It was a fast-hand applications, sorry, I couldn't have been on time to make it perfect :)

    Logging is on and stowed inside the 'bin' directory and produced by each application being on
    Actually there is one log more being written to the same directory where binaries are located
    This log is written by 'dispatcher' of the gateway.
    It is one more thread I launch for dispatchering of the gateway's tasks

6) Read logs and enjoy. Actually the gist was to demonstrate that
    this system meets the requrements to be called 'real time'
    But, you know, it is a sophistication and simulation
    But, actually, it resembles RTS and shows how gateway is trying to be in time!

7) The applications comunicate by means UNIX socket technology
